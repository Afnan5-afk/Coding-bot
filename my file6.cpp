using namespace std;//A shortcut that allows us write directly cout without std::
int main()//this is the main point where program starts
    {//{}these curly braces hold identities
    cout << "I am in \r CS department. \n";//Represents the standard output stream and these are called insertion operator and every single instruction must end with semicolon
    //n lets the statement go to the next line . r here moves the cursor back to the beginning of the current line
    
    cout << "I am programming \r enthusiast!";// r here moves the cursor back to the beginning of the current line
    
    return 0;   // return 0 means program has fortunately finished
    } // Here program ends
